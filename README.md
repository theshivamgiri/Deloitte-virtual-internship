# Data Analysis & Visualization Projects | Deloitte

During the Deloitte virtual internship, I completed two data-centric projects that involved data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Tableau and Microsoft Excel. These tasks provided hands-on experience in transforming raw data into actionable business intelligence.

# Task 1: Manufacturing Downtime Analysis with Tableau

The first project focused on identifying operational inefficiencies by analyzing machine telemetry data. My primary objective was to visualize and quantify machine downtime across different factories and device types.

My process involved:

Data Import & Preparation: I imported a large JSON dataset containing machine telemetry readings into Tableau.

Calculated Fields: I created a new calculated measure, "Unhealthy," to assign a quantitative value (10 minutes) to each instance of an unhealthy machine status, effectively translating status flags into a measurable downtime metric.

Visualization: I built two distinct bar charts: “Down Time per Factory” to compare overall downtime between locations, and “Down Time per Device Type” to pinpoint which machine types were most problematic.

Interactive Dashboard: I combined these visualizations into a single, interactive dashboard. A key feature was implementing a filter action, allowing a user to select a factory in the first chart to dynamically filter the second chart, providing a granular view of device-specific issues within that location.

# Task 2: Pay Equity Analysis with Excel

The second project shifted focus to HR analytics, where I analyzed employee compensation data to assess pay equity.

My process involved:

Data Classification: Working with an Excel spreadsheet containing equality scores, I created a new "Equality Class" column to categorize the numerical scores.

Conditional Logic: I applied a nested IF statement to classify each score into one of three categories: "Fair" (for scores between -10 and +10), "Unfair," or "Highly Discriminative," based on predefined thresholds. This task transformed a raw data point into a clear, qualitative indicator for HR review.

Through these projects, I demonstrated my ability to handle data from ingestion to final visualization, applying analytical techniques to derive meaningful insights for both operational and HR functions.
